# Product Context

## Problem & Goal
Security engineers juggle multiple tools (WAF/DAST/SAST, SIEM/TIP/SOAR, IAM). The platform unifies them behind simple module cards and minimal inputs to accelerate onboarding of new apps and log sources.

## Users
- Security engineers / SOC analysts managing web apps, logs, and identities.
- Developers needing quick security scans via URL or repo.

## Experience
- Dashboard with three clear modules (Web Security, Monitoring & IR, IAM).
- Each module has a single, simple config view (URL or repo for WebSec; log source/API key for Monitoring; users/roles for IAM).
- Apply triggers backend automation; results surfaced in dashboards, reports, alerts, and task statuses.

## Outcomes
- Faster time-to-first-scan/ingest.
- Centralized reports/artifacts and alerts.
- Consistent run/task tracking across tools.

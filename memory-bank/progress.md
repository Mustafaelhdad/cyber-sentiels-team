# Progress

## Current Status

- Memory bank initialized with scope, tech, patterns, and priorities.
- Codebase and infra not bootstrapped yet.

## Completed

- Documented vision, modules, tech stack, architecture flow, and MVP priorities (IAM-first, ZAP-only for Web Security, default UI).

## Next Milestones

- Create mono-repo structure and docker-compose baseline.
- Implement Sanctum auth and IAM basics.
- Build Dashboard + module config views; wire Apply to runs/jobs.
- Add ZAP container + job + report viewer.

## Risks / Notes

- Tool integrations beyond ZAP are deferred; timelines to be set after baseline.
